I designed a legal consultancy website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on both functionality and visual appeal. The structure and content were built using HTML, while CSS was used to style the layout, ensuring a professional and responsive design suitable for all devices. JavaScript was integrated to enhance user interaction, such as dynamic navigation menus and form validations. The website effectively presents the consultancyâ€™s services, contact details, and company information in a clean and user-friendly interface.
